## Project Management Overview

**Objective:** Provide managers with a foundational understanding of how Projects function as the primary organizational unit for time tracking and financial reporting in Beebole. 

**Writing Guidance:** Use a professional yet accessible tone. Define "Projects" broadly (clients, internal tasks, etc.) and emphasize the flexible, infinite hierarchy. Use active voice to describe the relationship between categories and sub-activities.

**Internal Linking:** Quickstart

**Visual Asset Suggestion:** A high-level diagram or screenshot showing a nested project structure (Category \> Project \> Activity \> Sub-activity).

### Component Implementation

<Info>
  Projects are the backbone of your Beebole data. Whether you are tracking billable client work or internal administrative tasks, everything starts with a Project.
</Info>

<Accordion title="Understanding the Project Hierarchy">
  Beebole does not limit your depth. You can organize your work into:

  - **Categories:** The top-level folder (e.g., Client Name or Department).
  - **Projects:** The specific engagement or work stream.
  - **Activities:** Tasks within a project. You can nest these infinitely to create sub-tasks and granular work breakdowns.
</Accordion>

## Planning Your Structure

**Objective:** Guide users to conceptualize their project architecture before data entry to ensure long-term reporting accuracy.

**Writing Guidance:** Emphasize the "measure twice, cut once" philosophy. Recommend mapping the hierarchy on paper or a spreadsheet first. Mention that while easy to create, restructuring complex hierarchies later can be time-consuming.

**Internal Linking:** Custom Fields, Tags, Manager roles.

**Visual Asset Suggestion:** A "Best Practice" vs "Too Complex" comparison graphic.

### Component Implementation

<Tip>
  Before hitting the "New Project" button, we highly recommend mapping your hierarchy on paper—especially if you have multi-level sub-activities or complex billing requirements.
</Tip>

## Creating Projects

**Objective:** Instruct users on the two primary methods of data entry: manual creation and bulk import.

**Writing Guidance:** Use a step-by-step format. Ensure the distinction between adding a single entity and using the "Copy/Paste" bulk method is clear.

**Internal Linking:** Bulk Import Tool, Permission Roles.

**Visual Asset Suggestion:** A short video (Frame/Iframe) showing the transition from a spreadsheet to the Beebole bulk upload interface.

### Component Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Manual Creation">
    Navigate to the **Projects** module and click the **[+]** icon to add an individual project or category.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bulk Import">
    To add multiple projects at once, select the **Import** option. You can copy and paste data directly from Excel or Google Sheets.

    ![Screenshot showing the copy-paste interface for bulk project creation](/images/bulk-import-projects.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Hierarchy">
    Drag and drop projects into categories or nest activities within projects to establish your structure.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuring Project Details

**Objective:** Inform managers on how to enrich project data with costs, billing rules, and ownership. 

**Writing Guidance:** Focus on the "Configuration" phase. Use a list to show the breadth of options available per project.

**Internal Linking:** Billing, Costs, Budgets, Project Managers, Custom Fields, Tags.

**Visual Asset Suggestion:** Screenshot of the Project Settings sidebar highlighting where to find Costs and Billing tabs.

### Component Implementation

<Badge color="orange" />

Once a project is created, you can define specific parameters to power your reports:

- **Managers:** Assign specific users to oversee the project.
- **Costs & Billing:** Set hourly rates or fixed budgets.
- **Tags & Custom Fields:** Add metadata for advanced filtering (e.g., "Priority: High" or "Region: EMEA").

## Advanced Management & Troubleshooting

**Objective:** Address common edge cases like archiving old projects or fixing hierarchy errors. 

**Writing Guidance:** Use accordions to keep the page clean. Focus on "Safety First" when discussing deleting or moving projects.

**Internal Linking:** Archiving Projects, Data Migration, Reporting

**Visual Asset Suggestion:** Screenshot of the "Archive" button vs the "Delete" button.

### Component Implementation

<Accordion title="How do I move a project to a different category?">
  You can move projects using the organizational tree view. However, be aware that moving projects may impact existing reports filtered by the original category.
</Accordion>

<Warning>
  **Deleting vs. Archiving:** Deleting a project removes all associated time logs permanently. We recommend **Archiving** completed projects to retain historical data for your reports.
</Warning>

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Objective:** Provide quick answers to common logistical questions about project limits and visibility. 

**Writing Guidance:** Concise, direct answers to common support queries.

**Internal Linking:** User Permissions, Client Portal.

### Component Implementation

<Accordion title="Is there a limit to how many sub-levels I can create?">
  No. Beebole supports infinite levels of nesting for activities. However, for the best user experience for your employees, we recommend keeping it under four levels.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I restrict which employees see certain projects?">
  Yes. Project visibility is managed through **Groups** and **Permissions**. You can assign specific teams to specific projects.
</Accordion>
