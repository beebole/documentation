## Understanding People & Permissions

**Objective:** Define "People" in the context of Beebole as the core workforce entity and explain the default organizational hierarchy to ensure managers assign correct access levels. 

**Writing Guidance:** Use clear, authoritative language. Define the three base roles (Admin, Manager, Employee) immediately. Explain that "People" represents both the user account and the data profile (rates, schedules, etc.). 

**Internal Linking:** Permissions Matrix, Custom Roles, Security Settings. 

**Visual Asset Suggestion:** A table or graphic comparing the default capabilities of Administrators vs. Managers vs. Employees.

### Component Implementation

<Info>
  In Beebole, **People** refers to any user or team member tracking time, managing projects, or viewing reports. Each person is assigned a role that determines what they can see and do.
</Info>

<Accordion title="Default User Roles">
  - <Badge color="red" /> Full access to all data, billing, and system settings.
  - <Badge color="blue" /> Can view and approve time for their assigned teams/projects.
  - <Badge color="green" /> Standard access to log time and view their own personal dashboard.
</Accordion>

## Adding Your Team

**Objective:** Walk through the manual and bulk methods of importing users into the system. 

**Writing Guidance:** Focus on the "Getting Started" efficiency. Highlight the "Copy/Paste" feature as the fastest way to migrate from a spreadsheet. Mention that adding a person does not automatically invite them to log in. 

**Internal Linking:** Bulk Import Guide, Invitations. 

**Visual Asset Suggestion:** Screenshot of the "Add Person" modal and the "Import from Spreadsheet" toggle.

### Component Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Individual Entry">
    Click the **[+]** icon in the People module. Enter the required fields: Name, Email, and Initial Role.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bulk Import">
    If you have a large team, use the **Import** tool. Copy rows directly from your HR spreadsheet or CSV and paste them into the Beebole grid.

</Steps>

## Configuring Individual Profiles

**Objective:** Guide managers through the granular settings that define a person's work parameters, from financial rates to time-off logic. 

**Writing Guidance:** Organize by sub-topic. Use a task-based approach (e.g., "To set a schedule..."). Emphasize that these settings power the accuracy of labor cost reports and capacity planning. 

**Internal Linking:** Work Schedules, Time Off Allowances, Labor Costs, Custom Fields. 

**Visual Asset Suggestion:** Video (Frame/Iframe) navigating through a single person's profile tabs (Settings, Rates, Schedule).

### Component Implementation

Once a person is added, click their name to configure their specific profile:

- **Work Schedules:** Define standard working hours and holidays to calculate capacity.
- **Costs & Rates:** Input internal labor costs for margin reporting.
- **Managers:** Assign who is responsible for approving this person's timesheet.
- **Custom Fields:** Add unique identifiers like "Department," "Office Location," or "Employee ID."

<Tip>
  Setting up **Work Schedules** early is critical if you plan to use Beebole for tracking absences or calculating overtime.
</Tip>

## Onboarding: Sending Invitations

**Objective:** Explain how to grant users access to the platform once their profiles are configured. 

**Writing Guidance:** Clarify that adding a person is a two-step process: Creation, then Invitation. Explain the "Invite" button location clearly. 

**Internal Linking:** Login Troubleshooting, Password Resets. 

**Visual Asset Suggestion:** Screenshot of the "Send Invitation" button on an individual profile.

### Component Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Profile">
    Navigate to the person's profile page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send Email">
    Click the **Send Invitation** button. Beebole will send a secure link to the email address on file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Track Status">
    The profile will show a "Pending" status until the user sets their password and logs in for the first time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Note>

## Advanced Management & FAQ

**Objective:** Address common management tasks like offboarding and modifying roles. 

**Writing Guidance:** Use accordions for secondary information. Maintain a focus on data integrity. 

**Internal Linking:** Archiving Users, Audit Logs.

### Component Implementation

<Accordion title="What happens when someone leaves the company?">
  Do not delete the user, as this removes their historical time data. Instead, **Archive** the profile. This frees up a user seat while preserving all reported data for your archives.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I create a custom role (e.g., 'External Auditor')?">
  Yes. Under **Settings \> Roles**, you can clone an existing role and modify specific permissions to create a tailored access level.
