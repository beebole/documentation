description: "Integrate Beebole with Asana for task tracking and time logging"
---

## Integration Overview
You are currently using Asana to organize your work by projects and tasks. This integration replicates your Asana task structure in Beebole, so your employees can specify the time spent on every task.

The Asana structure can be replicated into Beebole's Resource Planning dashboard or its Project time tracking structure, which you can leverate with costs, billing and expenses, for further financial control.

All your projects and tasks will be automatically synchronized so no need to worry about dual maintenance. The automatic Asana synchronization can be stopped and continued at any point in time.
